        <p>THREE metamorphoses of the spirit do I designate to you: how the spirit becometh a camel, the camel a lion,
          and the
          lion
          at last a child.</p>

        <p>Many heavy things are there for the spirit, the strong load-bearing spirit in which reverence dwelleth: for
          the
          heavy
          and the heaviest longeth its strength.</p>

        <p>What is heavy? so asketh the load-bearing spirit; then kneeleth it down like the camel, and wanteth to be
          well
          laden.
        </p>

        <p>What is the heaviest thing, ye heroes? asketh the load-bearing spirit, that I may take it upon me and rejoice
          in my
          strength.</p>

        <p>Is it not this: To humiliate oneself in order to mortify one's pride? To exhibit one's folly in order to mock
          at
          one's
          wisdom?</p>

        <p>Or is it this: To desert our cause when it celebrateth its triumph? To ascend high mountains to tempt the
          tempter?
        </p>

        <p>Or is it this: To feed on the acorns and grass of knowledge, and for the sake of truth to suffer hunger of
          soul?
        </p>

        <p>Or is it this: To be sick and dismiss comforters, and make friends of the deaf, who never hear thy requests?
        </p>

        <p>Or is it this: To go into foul water when it is the water of truth, and not disclaim cold frogs and hot
          toads?</p>

        <p>Or is it this: To love those who despise us, and give one's hand to the phantom when it is going to frighten
          us?
        </p>

        <p>All these heaviest things the load-bearing spirit taketh upon itself: and like the camel, which, when laden,
          hasteneth
          into the wilderness, so hasteneth the spirit into its wilderness.</p>

        <p>But in the loneliest wilderness happeneth the second metamorphosis: here the spirit becometh a lion; freedom
          will
          it
          capture, and lordship in its own wilderness.</p>

        <p>Its last Lord it here seeketh: hostile will it be to him, and to its last God; for victory will it struggle
          with
          the
          great dragon.</p>

        <p>What is the great dragon which the spirit is no longer inclined to call Lord and God? "Thou-shalt," is the
          great
          dragon
          called. But the spirit of the lion saith, "I will."</p>

        <p>"Thou-shalt," lieth in its path, sparkling with gold- a scale-covered beast; and on every scale glittereth
          golden,
          "Thou
          shalt!"</p>

        <p>The values of a thousand years glitter on those scales, and thus speaketh the mightiest of all dragons: "All
          the
          values
          of things- glitter on me.</p>

        <p>All values have already been created, and all created values- do I represent. Verily, there shall be no 'I
          will'
          any
          more. Thus speaketh the dragon.</p>

        <p>My brethren, wherefore is there need of the lion in the spirit? Why sufficeth not the beast of burden, which
          renounceth
          and is reverent?</p>

        <p>To create new values- that, even the lion cannot yet accomplish: but to create itself freedom for new
          creating-
          that
          can
          the might of the lion do.</p>

        <p>To create itself freedom, and give a holy Nay even unto duty: for that, my brethren, there is need of the
          lion.</p>

        <p>To assume the ride to new values- that is the most formidable assumption for a load-bearing and reverent
          spirit.
          Verily,
          unto such a spirit it is preying, and the work of a beast of prey.</p>

        <p>As its holiest, it once loved "Thou-shalt": now is it forced to find illusion and arbitrariness even in the
          holiest
          things, that it may capture freedom from its love: the lion is needed for this capture.</p>

        <p>But tell me, my brethren, what the child can do, which even the lion could not do? Why hath the preying lion
          still
          to
          become a child?</p>

        <p>Innocence is the child, and forgetfulness, a new beginning, a game, a self-rolling wheel, a first movement, a
          holy
          Yea.</p>

        <p>Aye, for the game of creating, my brethren, there is needed a holy Yea unto life: its own will, willeth now
          the
          spirit;
          his own world winneth the world's outcast.</p>

        <p>Three metamorphoses of the spirit have I designated to you: how the spirit became a camel, the camel a lion,
          and
          the
          lion at last a child.Thus spake Zarathustra. And at that time he abode in the town which is called The Pied
          Cow.</p>
